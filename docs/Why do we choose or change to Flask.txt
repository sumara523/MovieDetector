Node.js(at first)
The first reason might be Node.js is free both for itself and a huge number of tools we can use in it.
The second reason is our team decide to work on this project in Java language instead of Python. 
As a result, we choose Node.js, Express, and MongoDB over django and flask.
The third reason might be Prof. Perry Donham's Piazza and Slides, which show creating web app using Webstorm and introduce Node.js in class.

Flask(Now)
The first reason is the same since flask also free.
The second reason is we have tried Node.js and we cannot get it working properly.
The third reason is we feel more familiar with python more that Java.
The fourth reason is Node.js has so many tutorial, but not quite helpful for what we work on.
The fifth reason python language is quite simple to work on.

As a logged-in user, I want to unsubscribe a specific movie in order to quit getting its update news and delete it from ÅgWatchlistÅh.

Problem:
        Q1: What will happen to the info they got before unsubscribing
        A1: The former info they got will stay as it is, but the user will not get a new notification

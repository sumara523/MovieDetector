As a logged-in user, I would like to type and search for a name of a movie in order to get the get movie detail(Title, Poster and Short story).

Problem:
        Q1: How will the users be able to search for movies?
        A1: The user can just type the movie name or keyword in the serach box and click submit.
        
        Q2: What if I just enter nothing?
        A2: The next page will warn the user to type in the keyword or movie name, so what they can do is go back to previous page.
